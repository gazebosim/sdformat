# sdformat Python API

This example shows how to use sdformat's Python API.

In the
[examples/python](https://github.com/gazebosim/sdformat/blob/main/examples/python)
folder there is a Python script that shows how to make use of this API.

> If you compiled sdformat from source you should modify your `PYTHONPATH`:
>
>  ```bash
>  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path to ws>/install/lib/python
>    ```

Now you can run the example:

```bash
$ python3 python_sdformat.py
```
