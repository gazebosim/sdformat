# sdformat #

SDFormat is an XML file format that describes environments, objects, and robots
in a manner suitable for robotic applications. SDFormat is capable of representing
and describing different physic engines, lighting properties, terrain, static
or dynamic objects, and articulated robots with various sensors, and acutators.
The format of SDFormat is also described by XML, which facilitates updates and
allows conversion from previous versions.

* SDFormat - The specification.
    * SDF - Synonym for SDFormat, though SDFormat should be preferred, as "SDF"
      is an acronym with other meanings.
* libsdformat - The C++ parsing code contained within this repository,
  which can be used to read SDFormat files and return a C++ interface.
