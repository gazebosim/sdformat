This python package encapsulates versioned python packages of gz library 
bindings such that the version number only has to be changed in this package. 
Here's an example of how to use this in a python test:

```python
from gz_test_deps import math  # instead of from gz import math7
from gz_test_deps.math import Vector3d  # instead of from gz.math7 import Vector3d
```
