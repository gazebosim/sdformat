        Version number of the SDFormat specification, consisting of major
        and minor versions delimited by a `.` character.
        A major version bump is required if older versions cannot be
        automatically converted to this version.
        A minor version bump is required when there are breaking changes that
        can be handled by the automatic conversion functionality encoded in the
        `*.convert` files.
