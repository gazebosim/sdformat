<!-- Model -->
<element name="model" required="*">
  <description>The model element defines a complete robot or any other physical object.</description>

  <attribute name="name" type="string" default="__default__" required="1">
    <description>
      The name of the model and its implicit frame. This name must be unique
      among all elements defining frames within the same scope, i.e., it must
      not match another //model, //frame, //joint, or //link within the same
      scope.
    </description>
  </attribute>

  <attribute name="canonical_link" type="string" default="" required="0">
    <description>
      The name of the model's canonical link, to which the model's implicit
      coordinate frame is attached. If unset or set to an empty string, the
      first `/link` listed as a direct child of this model is chosen as the
      canonical link. If the model has no direct `/link` children, it will
      instead be attached to the first nested (or included) model's implicit
      frame.
    </description>
  </attribute>
  <attribute name="placement_frame" type="string" default="" required="0">
    <description>The frame inside this model whose pose will be set by the pose element of the model. i.e, the pose element specifies the pose of this frame instead of the model frame.</description>
  </attribute>

  <element name="static" type="bool" default="false" required="0">
    <description>
      If set to true, the model is immovable; i.e., a dynamics engine will not
      update its position. This will also overwrite this model's `@canonical_link`
      and instead attach the model's implicit frame to the world's implicit frame.
      This holds even if this model is nested (or included) by another model
      instead of being a direct child of `//world`.
    </description>
  </element>

  <element name="self_collide" type="bool" default="false" required="0">
    <description>If set to true, all links in the model will collide with each other (except those connected by a joint). Can be overridden by the link or collision element self_collide property. Two links within a model will collide if link1.self_collide OR link2.self_collide. Links connected by a joint will never collide.</description>
  </element>

  <element name="allow_auto_disable" type="bool" default="true" required="0">
    <description>Allows a model to auto-disable, which is means the physics engine can skip updating the model when the model is at rest. This parameter is only used by models with no joints.</description>

    <description>
      Include resources from a URI. This can be used to nest models. The included resource can only contain one 'model' element. The URI can point to a directory or a file. If the URI is a directory, it must conform to the model database structure (see /tutorials?tut=composition&amp;cat=specification&amp;#defining-models-in-separate-files).

    <element name="placement_frame" type="string" default="" required="0">
      <description>The frame inside the included model whose pose will be set by the specified pose element. If this element is specified, the pose must be specified.</description>

    <attribute name="name" type="string" default="__default__" required="1">
      <description>A unique name for the model. This name must not match another nested model in the same level as this model.</description>

  <element name="enable_wind" type="bool" default="false" required="0">
    <description>If set to true, all links in the model will be affected by the wind. Can be overriden by the link wind property.</description>
