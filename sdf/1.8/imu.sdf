      <description>
        This string represents special hardcoded use cases that are commonly seen with typical robot IMU's:
          - CUSTOM: use Euler angle custom_rpy orientation specification.
                 The orientation of the IMU's reference frame is defined by adding the custom_rpy rotation
                 to the parent_frame.
          - NED: The IMU XYZ aligns with NED, where NED orientation relative to Gazebo world
                 is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class.
          - ENU: The IMU XYZ aligns with ENU, where ENU orientation relative to Gazebo world
                 is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class.
          - NWU: The IMU XYZ aligns with NWU, where NWU orientation relative to Gazebo world
                 is defined by the SphericalCoordinates class.
          - GRAV_UP: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in
                     the opposite direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x.
                     Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails.
                     Otherwise, IMU reference frame X-axis is defined by projection of grav_dir_x onto a plane
                     normal to the gravity vector. IMU reference frame Y-axis is a vector orthogonal to both
                     X and Z axis following the right hand rule.
          - GRAV_DOWN: where direction of gravity maps to IMU reference frame Z-axis with Z-axis pointing in
                       the direction of gravity. IMU reference frame X-axis direction is defined by grav_dir_x.
                       Note if grav_dir_x is parallel to gravity direction, this configuration fails.
                       Otherwise, IMU reference frame X-axis is defined by projection of grav_dir_x onto a plane
                       normal to the gravity vector. IMU reference frame Y-axis is a vector orthogonal to both
                       X and Z axis following the right hand rule.

        This field and parent_frame are used when localization is set to CUSTOM.
        Orientation (fixed axis roll, pitch yaw) transform from parent_frame to this IMU's reference frame.
        Some common examples are:
          - IMU reports in its local frame on boot. IMU sensor frame is the reference frame.
             Example: parent_frame="", custom_rpy="0 0 0"
          - IMU reports in Gazebo world frame.
             Example sdf: parent_frame="world", custom_rpy="0 0 0"
          - IMU reports in NWU frame.
             Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity;
             i.e. rotation between North-West-Up and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class.
             Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame="world", custom_rpy="0 0 0"
          - IMU reports in NED frame.
             Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity;
             i.e. rotation between North-East-Down and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class.
             Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame="world", custom_rpy="M_PI 0 0"
          - IMU reports in ENU frame.
             Uses SphericalCoordinates class to determine world frame in relation to magnetic north and gravity;
             i.e. rotation between East-North-Up and world (+X,+Y,+Z) frame is defined by SphericalCoordinates class.
             Example sdf given world is NWU: parent_frame="world", custom_rpy="0 0 -0.5*M_PI"
          - IMU reports in ROS optical frame as described in http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0103.html#suffix-frames, which is
             (z-forward, x-left to right when facing +z, y-top to bottom when facing +z).
             (default gazebo camera is +x:view direction, +y:left, +z:up).
             Example sdf: parent_frame="local", custom_rpy="-0.5*M_PI 0 -0.5*M_PI"

        Used when localization is set to GRAV_UP or GRAV_DOWN, a projection of this vector

        grav_dir_x is  defined in the coordinate frame as defined by the parent_frame element.
