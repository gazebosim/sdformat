      This pose (translation, rotation) describes the position and orientation
      of the link's center-of-mass-frame C relative to the link-frame L.
      The first three components (x y z) specify the position vector from Lo
      (the link-frame origin) to Co (the link's center of mass) as
      `x L̂x + y L̂y + z L̂ᴢ`, where L̂x, L̂y, L̂ᴢ are link-frame L's orthogonal unit
      vectors. The subsequent values characterize C's orientation relative to
      link-frame L as a sequence of Euler rotations
      (r p y) documented in http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=specify_pose.

    <description>
      This link's moments of inertia ixx, iyy, izz and products of inertia
      ixy, ixz, iyz about Co (the link's center of mass) for the unit vectors
      Ĉx, Ĉy, Ĉᴢ fixed in the center-of-mass-frame C.
      Note: the orientation of Ĉx, Ĉy, Ĉᴢ relative to L̂x, L̂y, L̂ᴢ is specified
      by the `pose` tag.
      To avoid compatibility issues associated with the negative sign
      convention for product of inertia, align Ĉx, Ĉy, Ĉᴢ with principal
      inertia directions so that all the products of inertia are zero.
      For more information about this sign convention, see the following
