<!-- Pose -->
<element name="pose" type="pose" default="0 0 0 0 0 0" required="0">
  <description>A pose (translation, rotation) expressed in the frame named by
  @relative_to. The first three components (x, y, z) represent the position of
  the element's origin (in the @relative_to frame). The rotation component
  represents the orientation of the element as either a sequence of Euler
  rotations (r, p, y), see http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=specify_pose,
  or as a quaternion (x, y, z, w), where w is the real component.</description>

  <attribute name="relative_to" type="string" default="" required="0">
    <description>
      If specified, this pose is expressed in the named frame. The named frame
      must be declared within the same scope (world/model) as the element that
      has its pose specified by this tag.

      If missing, the pose is expressed in the frame of the parent XML element
      of the element that contains the pose. For exceptions to this rule and
      more details on the default behavior, see
      http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=pose_frame_semantics.

      Note that @relative_to merely affects an element's initial pose and
      does not affect the element's dynamic movement thereafter.

      New in v1.8: @relative_to may use frames of nested scopes. In this case,
      the frame is specified using `::` as delimiter to define the scope of the
      frame, e.g. `nested_model_A::nested_model_B::awesome_frame`.

  <attribute name="rotation_format" type="string" default="euler_rpy" required="0">
    <description>'euler_rpy' by default. Supported rotation formats are
      'euler_rpy', Euler angles representation in roll, pitch, yaw. The pose is expected to have 6 values.
      'quat_xyzw', Quaternion representation in x, y, z, w. The pose is expected to have 7 values.

  <attribute name="degrees" type="bool" default="false" required="0">
    <description>
      Whether or not the euler angles are in degrees, otherwise they will be interpreted as radians by default.
