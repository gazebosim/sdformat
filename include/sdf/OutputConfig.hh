/// the `<include>` tags using the following snippet.

/// \code{.cpp}

///   // You can now output the element as a string.

  /// XML Element populated from the contents of the DOM object. When

  /// URI instead of copying the full details of the included model.
  /// This method lets you set this behavior.
  /// \param[in] _useIncludeTag When true, the model's URI is used to create
  /// an SDF `<include>` rather than a `<model>`. The model's URI must be
  /// first set using the `Model::SetUri` function. If the model's URI is
  /// empty, then a `<model>` element will be generated. The default is true
  /// so that URI values are used when ToElement is called from a
  /// World object. Make sure to use `Model::SetUri` even when the model
  /// is loaded from an `<include>` tag since the parser will
  /// automatically expand an `<include>` element to a `<model>` element.
